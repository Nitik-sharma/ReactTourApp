            Amarnath is one of the most famous pilgrimage destinations of India
            and is organized every year by the government of Jammu and Kashmir
            online train tickets. The shrine has an important part to play in
            Hindu culture and is considered to be one of the holiest shrines.
            The main cave is situated at a height of 12,756 ft from the sea
            level and remains covered with snow most of the year except for a
            short period of time in summer. Every year 'Amarnath Yatra' is
            marked by 'Pratham Pujan' which is said to summon the blessings of
            Baba Amarnath and attracts a large number of devotees from all over
            the world.

              The Legend and the Belief of Amarnath Yatra:-
            </span>
            As per the beliefs, the Amarnath Cave is where God Shiva was
            narrating Amar Katha to Goddess Parvati and wanted to keep it a
            secret. Therefore, he left all his companions behind. His riding
            friend - Nandi, the bull - was left at Pahalgam, the moon atop his
            head at Chandanwari, the snake around his neck at Lake Sheshnag, the
            5 basic essentials of life that he carried at Panchtarini and even
            his son- Lord Ganesha himself- at Mahaguna top. When he finished the
            narration, he realized that Goddess Parvati has actually fallen
            asleep and a parrot was listening all this while. This infuriated
            the Lord and he threw his Trishul to kill the parrot. To save
            himself, the parrot entered the womb of the saintâ€™s wife. The baby
            was later born to become a famous sage.

              Safety guidelines for Amarnath Yatra-2020:-
            </span>
            Physical fitness is essential for completing Amarnath Yatra with
            ease. We advise you to take morning or evening walks for at least
            4-5 km regularly for a month prior to Amarnath Yatra. As Amarnath
            Cave Temple is situated at a high altitude you need to increase the
            oxygen efficiency of your body. Practice deep breathing exercises
            and yoga, particularly pranayama. Amarnath Yatra will take you
            through cold weather at high altitudes where cold winds will be
            blowing constantly. You must carry woollen clothing, small umbrella
            with a strap around the chin to cover your head, raincoat,
            waterproof trekking shoes, torch, walking stick, woollen cap,
            jacket, and socks. The climate at the yatra route changes abruptly
            and hence all the above mentioned items are essential.

          <p className="text-sm font-medium p-1">
            There are two Amarnath Yatra routes that pilgrims can take to travel
            Amarnath Cave and both these routes are well connected from all the
            major cities for easy connectivity. To start from Srinagar or
            Pahalgam, one will have to trek to a height of more than 14,000
            feet. Hence, being physically fit and mentally prepared for the
            journey is a must. The two routes to Amarnath Yatra are:

            Yatra from Baltal to Amarnath Cave:
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm font-medium p-1">
            It is the most popular and shortest route to reach the cave. The
            region of Baltal is 14 km from the Cave and allows people to only
            walk. Ponies are not allowed. However, one can be carried on
            'Dandies'. The trek via Baltal usually takes 1-2 days to complete.
            This route is advised to be taken by the people who are young,
            healthy and looking for some adventure amidst the religious trip.
